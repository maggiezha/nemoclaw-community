NemoClaw Community is a collection of examples showcasing NemoClaw blueprints for constrained, inspectable agent workflows.

NemoClaw is the blueprint layer for composing three things into a repeatable agent system:

- **Model** — the inference endpoint, model selection, and provider configuration the agent uses.
- **Harness** — the agent runtime, skills, bridges, state, and workflow-specific behavior.
- **OpenShell** — the sandbox, gateway, policy, provider, and networking substrate that runs the harness with explicit boundaries.

The examples in this repository demonstrate complete blueprint patterns: they show how a model is wired to a harness, how the harness is packaged with skills and integrations, and how OpenShell constrains and runs the resulting agent.

## Reference Examples

Examples are organized as reusable NVIDIA and partner recipes, NVIDIA field
demos, environment launchables, and standalone developer tools. Browse the
[example catalog](examples/README.md) to choose a workflow and follow its
independent setup and verification guide.

Additional NemoClaw examples are available in
[brevdev/nemoclaw-demos](https://github.com/brevdev/nemoclaw-demos).

## Getting Started

Choose an example from the [example catalog](examples/README.md) and follow its
guide. To run an example from this repository, clone the repo first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemoclaw-community.git
cd nemoclaw-community
```

Each example documents its own host requirements, credentials, setup steps, and OpenShell policy details.

## Requirements

- Linux host with Docker or a compatible container runtime
- OpenShell CLI and gateway
- Access to an OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint
- Optional integration credentials for Slack, Microsoft Graph/Outlook, GitHub live reads, and source ETL mirrors

Running these examples may download and install additional third-party open source software. Review the license terms of that software before use. See [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES) for the repository inventory.
